    "<a id='motivation'></a>\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Linear algebra is the study of vector spaces, and it encompasses linear equations and functions represented by vector spaces and matrices. Vectors and matrices are essential for storing data, which is why we often use Python packages such as Numpy and Pandas. A common problem is linear regression, which we will delve into solving using matrices and linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='notation'></a>\n",
    "## Notation\n",
    "Common notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{A}$: Bold capital letters represent matrices\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{x}$: Bold lowercase letters represent vectors\n",
    "* $\\theta$: Non-bold values represent scalars\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='terminology'></a>\n",
    "## Matrix Terminology\n",
    "* **Identity** matrix: A square matrix with diagonal elements equal to $1$ and all off diagonal elements equal to zero. A $n\\times n$ identity matrix is often denoted as $I$ or $I_n$.\n",
    "* **Order or Size** of matrix: If a matrix has m rows and n columns, the order of the matrix is $m\\times n$. We denote the set of (real-valued) matrices $\\mathbb{M}_{m,n}$\n",
    "* **Transpose** of a matrix: The transpose of matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ satisfies the condition $\\mathbf{A_{j,i}} = \\mathbf{A_{i,j}}^T$. That is, the first row of $\\mathbf{A}$ is the first column of $\\mathbf{A}^T$.\n",
    "* **Square** matrix: A matrix with the same number of rows as columns. This matrix is in the shape of a square.\n",
    "* **Diagonal** matrix: A matrix with all the non-diagonal elements equal to $0$ is called a diagonal matrix.\n",
    "* **Scalar** matrix: An identity matrix multiplied by a constant.\n",
    "* **Column** matrix: A matrix which consists of exactly $1$ column. If it has $m$ rows, it can be treated as a $m\\times 1$ vector. \n",
    "* **Row** matrix: A matrix which consists of exactly $1$ row. If it has $n$ columns, it can be treated as a $1\\times n$ vector. \n",
    "* **Determinant**: A scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix and encodes certain properties of the linear transformation described by the matrix.\n",
    "* **Rank**: The maximal number of linearly independent columns of a matrix.\n",

    "## Matrix Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='transpose'></a>\n",
    "### Transpose\n",
    "Transpose converts row vectors into column vectors, and vice versa. For example, for a $3 \\times 2$ matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ where $$ \\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 4\\\\ 7 & 0 \\\\ 3 & 1\\end{bmatrix}, \\mathbf{A}^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 7 & 3\\\\ 4 & 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $$(\\mathbf{A}^T)^T = \\mathbf{A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='addsub'></a>\n",
    "### Addition & Subtraction\n",
    "if $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ are both $m \\times n$, we form $\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B}$ by adding corresponding entries. $$\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2\\\\ a_3 & a_4 \\end{bmatrix}, \\mathbf{B} = \\begin{bmatrix} b_1 & b_2\\\\ b_3 & b_4 \\end{bmatrix}, \\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1+b_1 & a_2+b_2\\\\ a_3+b_3 & a_4+b_4 \\end{bmatrix}$$ A fact about matrix addition and transpose is that $(\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B})^T = \\mathbf{A}^T + \\mathbf{B}^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can perform subtraction in the same way, where we form $\\mathbf{A} - \\mathbf{B}$ by subtracting entries of $\\mathbf{B}$ from corresponding entries of $\\mathbf{A}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can only perform matrix addition and subtraction when both matrices in the operation have the same dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='scalar_mul'></a>\n",
    "### Scalar Multiplication\n",
    "We can multiply a scalar (a.k.a. number) by a matrix by multiplying every entry of the matrix by the scalar. This is denoted $\\cdot$ between the scalar and the matrix. $$c \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2\\\\ a_3 & a_4 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} c\\times a_1 & c\\times a_2\\\\ c\\times a_3 & c\\times a_4 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='matrix_mul'></a>\n",
    "### Matrix Multiplication\n",
    "If $\\mathbf{A}$ is $m \\times p$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ is $p \\times n$, we can form $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}$, which has dimension $m \\times n$. For matrix multiplication to occur, the number of columns of $\\mathbf{A}$ has to equal the number of rows of $\\mathbf{B}$. A fact about matrix multiplication and transpose is that $(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B})^T = \\mathbf{B}^T\\mathbf{A}^T$.$$\\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13}\\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} b_{11} & b_{12}\\\\ b_{21} & b_{22} \\\\ b_{31} & b_{32} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{a_{1\\cdot}}\\cdot \\mathbf{b_{\\cdot1}} & \\mathbf{a_{1\\cdot}}\\cdot \\mathbf{b_{\\cdot2}}\\\\ \\mathbf{a_{2\\cdot}}\\cdot \\mathbf{b_{\\cdot1}} & \\mathbf{a_{2\\cdot}}\\cdot \\mathbf{b_{\\cdot2}} \\end{bmatrix}$$ where $\\mathbf{a_{i\\cdot}}$ is the $i$th row of matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{b_{\\cdot j}}$ is the $j$th column of matrix $\\mathbf{B}.$\n",
    "\n",

    "<a id='linear_independence'></a>\n",
    "## Linear Independence\n",
    "What does it mean for a set of vectors to be **linearly independent**? It is easier to define what it means to be linearly dependent. A set of vectors $$\\mathbf{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n}$$ is linearly dependent if there exist scalars ${\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, ..., \\alpha_n}$, not all equal to 0 such that $$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_ix_i = 0.$$\n",
    "In words, this means that there exists at least one vector that can be written as a linear combination of the remaining vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='invert'></a>\n",
    "## Invertibility\n",
    "The inverse of an $n\\times n$ matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, denoted as $\\mathbf{A}^{-1}$, satisfies the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{A A}^{-1} = I_{n\\times n},\\ \\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\mathbf{A}=I_{n\\times n}.$$\n",
    "We may consider a concrete example with a $2\\times 2$ matrix. \n",
    "$$\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b\\\\ c & d\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{A}^{-1} = (\\det \\mathbf{A})^{-1}\\begin{bmatrix} d & -b\\\\ -c & a\\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{ad-bc} \\begin{bmatrix} d & -b\\\\ -c & a\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For inverting matrices of higher dimensions, the calculation is much more difficult. We will often want to use a computer to compute these for us. But why do we care about inverse matrices in the first place? Why do they come up in linear regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to this will show up toward the end of this lecture when we consider the normal equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember for later: If a matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is invertible, so is its transpose, and the inverse of $\\mathbf{A}^T$ is the transpose of the inverse of $\\mathbf{A}$: $(\\mathbf{A}^T)^{-1} = (\\mathbf{A}^{-1})^T$."

Your boss gives you a bunch of data involving the speed of a car as well as the distance traveled by a car and it is your job to find some association.

    "### Why Make A Model?\n",
    "We often find that in the real world, many problems can be (accurately) described by models created by you, the data scientist. You can make a model as an attempt to describe the relationship between many related things, such as the year a computer was made as well as how much memory it can hold. With enough data, you can begin to make predictions such as how much memory a computer may hold in 5 years (hence, the create of [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law))\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to keep in mind what you are analyzing. Just because you can make a model describing the relationship between two variables, and even if you can use this model to predict the value of one variable based on the value of the other, it doesn't mean that one causes the other. You may have heard this before as the difference between **correlation** and **causation**. A classic example is the relationship between ice cream sales and murder rates. Turns out, when ice cream sales rise, so do murder rates. Does this mean ice cream *causes* people to commit murder? Or get murdered? Nope!\n",

    "## Linear Regression\n",
    "**Linear regression** is a method of making linear models. Linear model is one kind of model, in which the relationship between the explanatory variables and the response variable can be described by a linear function. For now, you can just think of a linear function as a straight line, which takes us to *simple linear regression*.\n",

    "Using known $x$'s, we want to accurately predict $y$ using the right $\\hat{\\theta_0}$ and $\\hat{\\theta_1}$. Note that here we're putting a hat on the $\\theta$'s: this is because the data sample $y_i$ we have will not be perfect (with error terms). Here, the data points we have will have some unobserved deviations from the model function above, and we model this deviation using $\\epsilon_i$. Hence, the data points we have follow\n",

    "You're probably thinking \"COOL! This looks like a pretty good representation of the data! But what do these coefficients even mean?\" That is a great question! As you might have guessed, the `intercept` term is where our line intersects with the y-axis, or when our predictor variable has a value of 0. In relation to our model, it's our prediction for `mpg` given a predictor variable value of 0. The `slope` term is a little more complicated. Yes, it is the slope of the line, but how do we interpret it in the relationship between `mpg` and our explanatory variable?"

One way of measuring how well your model fits the data is the $R^2$ coefficient, or the **coefficient of determination**. Basically, what the $R^2$ represents is how much our data can vary but still be predicted accurately by the explanatory variable. $$R^2 = 1- \\frac{\\sum_{i}e_i^2}{\\sum_{i}(y_i-\\bar{y})^2}$$ Intuitively, $R^2$ measures how much better our fitted model is doing compared to the most basic model where we predict $\\hat{y}_i = \\bar{y}$ for every data point."

The points are more spread out vertically for smaller values of `displacement` and less scattered vertically for larger values. Furthermore, in the middle the residuals are mostly above the line, while on the left and right side, the residuals tend to be below the line. Such a pattern as this one suggests that our model isn't that great at describing the relationship between `displacement` and `mpg`, and there's some fundamental issue with the assumption that the relationship can be modeled by a simple linear relationship. [Here](http://docs.statwing.com/interpreting-residual-plots-to-improve-your-regression/)'s some more information about how to interpret different patterns in residual plots and how you can change your model to fix these errors."
